        <h2>Define User Needs</h2>
        <p>During the Empathize phase, insights were consolidated and analyzed to identify core issues, leading to the
          creation of a problem statement:</p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote><span class="features">Entrepreneurs face difficulties in obtaining timely, reliable, and
            affordable legal
            services
            to safeguard their business interests. In response, a web application was developed to offer
            cost-effective, easy access to
            trustworthy legal advice and information, enabling entrepreneurs to address common legal questions
            efficiently, saving time
            and money.</span></blockquote>
        <p>Subsequently, to humanize the design process, personas were developed:
        </p>
        <h3>Personas Development</h3>

        <h3>User Journeys</h3>
        <p>A user journey illustrates the sequence of actions taken by someone using a product to achieve a goal.
          Let's look at how Sebastian and Pamela would use the app for legal advice:
        </p>

        </div>
        <h3>User Flows</h3>
        <p>User flows map out the steps users take to complete tasks within the app, crucial for understanding and
          improving user experience. For each app feature, specific user flows are designed. The flows for the
          features
          "Ask a Lawyer" and "Legal DocCreator" are outlined to facilitate these tasks.</p>

        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <p>üí° After thoroughly understanding the users and defining the problem, the Ideation Phase began.</p>
        <p>üí≠ This phase involved brainstorming numerous possible solutions, leading to the development of a Sitemap
          that outlines the structure of the web application.</p>
        <p>‚úÖ The Sitemap was refined using Card Sorting Results, which then paved the way for designing low and
          mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
        <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
        <p>Card sorting is a technique used in user research where participants organize content into categories,
          which helps optimize the structure of websites and apps.

        </picture>
        <p>The open card sorting exercise provided key insights:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Many participants, unfamiliar with legal terms,
            <span class="features">struggled to classify items accurately</span>. Despite this, maintaining the
            existing
            legal categorization made sense (Ask a Lawyer and DocCreator as 2 separate features).
          </li>
          <li>The exercise emphasized the importance of a <span class="features">comprehensive onboarding
              process</span>
            to help users comprehend the application's functions and navigate it
            effectively.</li>
          <li>Also, to address user confusion, the feature Q&A section with FAQs should be added. <span
              class="features">Legal services can be complex
              for non-lawyers</span>.</li>
          <li>The exercise highlighted the need to exclude "My legal documents" and "My lawyers' answers" from the "My
            profile" section and <span class="features">remove several cards to simplify processes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In response to the card sorting results and an usability test, the site map was modified a couple times to
          align with user expectations of legal services, simplifying content
          organization. Categories were minimized, enhancing the application's navigability and user comprehension:

        <h2>Prototyping Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          From the site map design, inexpensive paper prototypes were developed and later refined into medium and high
          fidelity prototypes, as you can see below:
        </p>
        <h4>1. Onboarding</h4>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The initial onboarding, which focused on consulting a lawyer and creating legal documents, was
            restructured based on feedback and usability tests. The revised design now prominently features four main
            functions: Ask a Lawyer, DocsCreator, Doc Access, and a Legal Updates Newsletter.</p>

          </picture>
        </div>
        <h4>2. Ask a Laywer</h4>
        <div class="section">
          <p>The prototype was repeatedly redesigned to address usability issues.
            Key improvements included changing order of steps and adding progress notifications for the 48-hour lawyer
            response period, and enhancing its appeal by featuring a
            network of verified lawyers with credible profiles.</p>
          <div class="centered-picture">

          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>3. Access to Docs</h4>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Initially, users accessed a "My Library" section for all app activities like past legal advice
            and document creation. However, difficulties arose in locating specific "documents created" and "lawyers'
            answers." Splitting these into two distinct sections enhanced navigation and comprehension. The subsequent
            challenge involved deciding what information to feature on the home page to distinguish it from the "My
            Profile" section.</p>
          <div class="centered-picture">

            </picture>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h4>4. Create a LegalDoc</h4>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Many users found it challenging to start the document creation process, often searching
            extensively or
            needing help. To address this, labels were added to the menu for clarity, aiming to enhance user
            understanding and ease of navigation.

        <h4>Report of Errors and Recommendations</h4>
        <p>üëçüèº Users appreciated the main features, the quick and easy process to schedule meetings, the form-filling
          ease, the verification of information before creating legal documents, the visibility of lawyer profiles,
          the search bar functionality, and the option to choose meeting times.</p>
        <p>‚ö†Ô∏è The usability test revealed critical areas for improvement in design, feature visibility, and user
          onboarding. Balancing the seriousness of legal matters with a user-friendly interface is key. Incorporating
          direct and clear communication options will enhance user satisfaction and trust.

              style="justify-content: left; color: #7390f9;"> Rainbow spreadsheet</a>, are:</p>
          <p><b>1. 'Create a Document' Feature</b>: Users struggle to find the feature; recommended solution is to
            rename the
            icon to "DocCreator" and enhance the onboarding process. </p>
          <p><b>2. Locating Created Documents</b>: Difficulty in locating documents can be addressed by adding a "List
            of
            Documents Created" on the Home, "My Profile" or DocCreator category.</p>
          <p><b>3. Finding Lawyers' Responses</b>: To ease access to lawyers' responses,the icon should be
            more descriptive and add "Ask a Lawyer." </p>
          <p><b>4. Identifying User Profile</b>: Users confuse the profile section with home, so it is needed to
            differentiate profile information from, homepage content and main features.</p>
          <p><b>5. Confirmation of Document Creation</b>: Uncertainty about document readiness can be resolved by
            implementing
            a design that visually indicates readiness. </p>
          <p><b>6. Verification of Legal Document Authenticity</b>: Enhancing the layout to clearly signify the
            authenticity
            of legal documents can address verification issues.</p>
          <p><b>7. Clarity in Document Lists</b>: To improve document list clarity, distinct formatting and icons for
            document
            titles are recommended. </p>
          <p><b>8. Clarification of Meeting Type</b>: Confusion over meeting communication methods can be clarified by
            specifying the method (e.g., Microsoft or Google Meetings). </p>
          <p><b>9. Direct Contact with Lawyers</b>: Improving system visibility, potentially with a progress bar, can
            address issues in direct lawyer contact. </p>
        </div>
        <h4>Two Personas Emerged</h4>
        <p>Two user categories emerged: financially privileged entrepreneurs who value app elegance and lower-income
          users focused on affordability and ease of use.
        </p>
        <p>Based on the goal of this project, feedback from the target persona of entrepreneurs in need of
          affordable legal advice will be prioritized.</p>
        <h4>The Need to Alleviate Legal Service Concerns</h4>
        <p>During the usability tests, users expressed concerns about the cost and complexity of legal services.
          Recognizing the need to create a calming and reassuring app environment, research was done on colors that
          evoke calmness. Blue and green were identified as suitable choices for the legal app due to their calming
          properties.</p>
        <p>A color preference test was conducted to decide between the two, resulting in a strong preference for
          blue, with 83% of participants favoring it over green. Blue was thus selected for the app's design,
          supported by user feedback highlighting blue as a classic and trustworthy color.

        <h4>Visual and Language Design</h4>
        <p>1. Blue was chosen as the main color after a preference test due to its association with trust.</p>
        <p>2. Lawyer photos and a white background were used for a professional look.</p>
        <p>3. Friendly, non-judgmental language was selected to make users feel supported and encourage open
          engagement with legal issues.</p>

        <h2>Iteration: Last and Upcoming Steps</h2>
        <h3>Design Harmony and Accessibility Commitment</h3>
        <p>The design of the Untangled app has evolved through a collaborative and iterative process, incorporating
          feedback from UX peers and adhering to <a
            href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles#what_are_the_gestalt_principles?-0"
            target="_blank" style="color: #00306b;">Gestalt Theory</a> and <a

          color scheme, although integration of technology to aid users with different abilities is still underway.
        </p>
        <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
        <p>The design refinements have been significantly influenced by suggestions from fellow UX designers,
          leading to a more sophisticated version of the app. Key features are established, yet "DocCreator" and
          Chatbot functionalities require further development for enhanced performance.

        </picture>
        <h3>User-Centered Approach</h3>
        <p>Ongoing evaluations are crucial for aligning with business objectives and maintaining pricing
          accessibility. Regular user assessments focusing on UI testing, A/B testing, accessibility, and additional
          usability testing are planned to ensure the app meets user expectations and needs.
        </p>
        <h3>Future Analyses</h3>
        <p>Separate analyses for different stakeholders such as lawyers and legal firms are planned to tailor the
          service offerings to their requirements.</p>

        <h3>Reflecting on Design Changes</h3>
        <p>The web app has undergone considerable modifications from its inception. For instance, initial ambiguity
          about the home screen's function was resolved by featuring a newsletter highlighting recent legal updates,
          increasing user engagement and support for legal inquiries. The introduction of services like a regulatory
          change newsletter has significantly influenced the overall design. While the UI has been enhanced through
          tools like Figma and design principles, opportunities for improvement remain.
        </p>
        <h4>Distinctive Market Position</h4>
        <p>Untangled differentiates itself by catering specifically to Ecuadorian entrepreneurs, acknowledging the
          unique challenges of the local regulatory environment. Its design prioritizes affordability and reliability
          in
          legal services, including a section for regulatory updates which is vital in dynamic legal contexts.
        </p>

        <h4>Enhancement Opportunities</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Simplifying Forms</b>: Incorporating AI could streamline the process of filling out lengthy forms,
            boosting user interaction.</li>
          <li><b>Personalization</b>: Adding a feature for users to provide business-specific details could offer
            more tailored legal advice and efficiency for lawyers.</li>
          <li><b>Broadening User Base</b>: While focusing on cost-conscious entrepreneurs, potential exists to also
            attract affluent entrepreneurs seeking a sophisticated user experience.</li>
          <li><b>Trust and Comfort</b>: The design should continue to emphasize trust and tranquility, crucial for
            users concerned with legal costs.</li>
          <li><b>Legal Collaboration</b>: Partnering with more legal professionals could provide a wider range of
            services and pricing, adding value to the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Challenges and Tools</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Usability Testing</b>: Conducting tests solo was challenging. More extensive testing, especially in
            person
            with an assistant, could capture more nuanced feedback.</li>
          <li><b>Legal Insights</b>: Time constraints limited collaboration with legal professionals, an aspect that
            could
            greatly enrich the app's offerings.</li>
          <li><b>Time Constraints</b>: Additional time was required for the complete development of the DocsCreator
            feature, for more complex documentation.</li>
        </ul>
