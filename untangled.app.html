          <div>
            <h3>Research Goals</h3>
            <p>The very first step: ‚û°Ô∏è To deeply understand the problems faced by entrepreneurs when seeking legal
              advice.
            </p>
            <p>The main objectives of the research were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Identify <span class="features">entrepreneurs' actions</span> when they require legal assistance.</li>
              <li>Understand their <span class="features">most common legal needs</span>.</li>
              <li>Uncover <span class="features">frustrations</span> experienced in obtaining legal advice.</li>
              <li>Determine the <span class="features">optimal approach</span> to meeting these needs and addressing
                frustrations.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Research Methods</h3>
            <p>A multifaceted approach was needed involving:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
              <li>Surveys and Interviews</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>üìà The research project began with a competitive analysis to gather user insights and frustrations,
              identify
              product
              weaknesses, and uncover opportunities for differentiation and improvement.
            </p>
            <p>üåé In Ecuador, there is currently a lack of highly developed legal apps, similar to those in the United
              States
              and Europe.</p>
            <p>üì≤ To draw inspiration, we studied two popular platforms, <span class="features">LegalZoom</span> and
              <span class="features">Rocket Lawyer</span>, and incorporated
              feedback from app reviews, including App Review, TechCrunch, GetApp, and more.

            <h3>Surveys and Interviews</h3>
            <p>Surveys provided preliminary insights, while interviews delved deeper into user preferences and
              requirements.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The interviews with the entrepreneurs covered a wide range of ages, from 28 to 54 years old, the age
                range in which most Ecuadorian entrepreneurs are found.</li>
              <li>There were a total of 5Ô∏è‚É£ interviews.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here's a quick summary of the 9 key findings:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Competitive analysis-based hypothesis focuses on app features but neglects specific legal needs and
                regulatory awareness.</li>
              <li>People typically seek advice from their trusted network for basic legal matters but are open to using
                legal apps.</li>
              <li>Desired app features encompass FAQs, lawyer consultations, document templates, reminders, in-app
                payments, and real-time guidance.</li>
              <li>Interviewees prioritize payment transparency, flexible payment options, and good customer service.
              </li>
              <li>Common legal needs include model contracts, notary proceedings, affidavits, deeds, and intellectual
                property protection.</li>
              <li>Some individuals stay informed about legal changes through news sources and social media.</li>
              <li>For tax-related legal matters, nearly all users turn to their accountants.</li>
              <li>Full-time entrepreneurs require comprehensive legal support, especially in areas like tax, labor, and
                intellectual property protection.</li>
              <li>Most interviewees need a lawyer several times a year, particularly those involved in business
                operations.</li>

        <div class="solution">
          <p>üí° Following a deep dive into user understanding and the definition of the problem statement, <span
              class="features">the Ideation Phase was initiated.</span></p>
          <p>üí≠ A wide array of potential solutions was brainstormed, resulting in the creation of a <span
              class="features">Sitemap</span>‚Äîa tool that represents the structure of the web application.</p>
          <p>‚úÖ The initial Sitemap was subsequently refined based on <span class="features">Card Sorting Results</span>,
            allowing for the progression to the design of low and mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
          <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
          <p>Card sorting is a user research method where participants categorize information to improve website and app
            organization.</p>

          </picture>
          <p>During the open card sorting exercise, where participants independently group and label website content,
            many
            important insights became evident. Here are the main ones:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Many participants, unfamiliar with legal terms,
              <span class="features">struggled to classify items accurately</span>. Despite this, maintaining the
              existing
              legal categorization made sense (Ask a Lawyer and DocCreator as 2 separate features).
            </li>
            <li>The exercise emphasized the importance of a <span class="features">comprehensive onboarding
                process</span>
              to help users comprehend the application's functions and navigate it
              effectively.</li>
            <li>Also, to address user confusion, the feature Q&A section with FAQs should be added. <span
                class="features">Legal services can be complex
                for non-lawyers</span>.</li>
            <li>The exercise highlighted the need to exclude "My legal documents" and "My lawyers' answers" from the "My
              profile" section and <span class="features">remove several cards to simplify processes</span>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In response to the card sorting results and an usability test, the site map has been updated three times,
            leading to this latest version:</p>

            <p><span class="features">Three noteworthy findings are:</span></p>
            <h4>Discoverability Issues</h4>
            <p>The 6 usability tests revealed issues mostly related to discoverability. Users appreciated the app's
              utility but struggled with tasks 1, 3, and 4, and often confused between "profile" and "home".</p>
            <h4>Two Personas Emerged</h4>
            <p>User feedback has illuminated two distinct user categories:</p>
            <li>Financially privileged entrepreneurs seeking elegance in the app</li>
            <li>Lower-income users concerned about affordability and user-friendliness.</li>
            <p>Based on the goal of this project, feedback from the target persona of entrepreneurs in need of
              affordable legal advice will be prioritized. However, this depends on business goals.
            </p>
            <h4>The Need to Alleviate Legal Service Concerns</h4>
            <p>During the usability test, I observed that certain users expressed apprehension regarding the cost of
              legal services and the complexity of legal issues, understandably so, as these topics can be unsettling
              for many. After conducting research on colors known to evoke a sense of calmness, I determined that
              using
              blue and green would be suitable color options for a legal app.</p>
            <p>A preference test regarding colors was performed. The results of the test revealed a significant
              distinction between blue and green colors, with
              83% favoring blue. Therefore, blue tones were chosen. One user even
              remarked that blue is a classic, clean color often associated with trust.</p>
            <picture class="zoom">

            </picture>
            <h4>Visual Design</h4>
            <p>To further convey a friendly and trustworthy image, this color palette was designed:
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
              <img src="img/untangled/@2colorp.png" alt="color palette">
            </div>
            <p>To convey a friendly and trustworthy image, friendly and trustworthy visuals, such as approachable lawyer
              photos, were incorporated. These lawyer photographs are intended to effectively convey the seriousness and
              expertise of the lawyers while nurturing authenticity, trust, and empathy. The use of a white background
              further enhances a polished and professional aesthetic.
            </p>
            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
              <img src="img/untangled/@2_ask.png" alt="characters" style="max-width: 80%;">
            </div>
            <p>To address confidentiality and image management concerns, I've replaced the pictures of the lawyers I
              previously collaborated with. As an illustration, I've included a photo of myself from my time practicing
              law, ensuring alignment with the app's parameters
            </p>
            <h4>Language</h4>
            <p>Finally, the app should maintain a friendly and approachable tone, ensuring that users feel understood
              and supported throughout their legal journey. By using non-judgmental language, the app aims to break down
              any barriers
              or stigma associated with legal issues. This approach fosters an environment of trust and encourages users
              to openly engage with their legal concerns, empowering them to seek the support they need confidently.

              target="_blank" style="color: #00306b;">Gestalt Theory</a> and <a

              Principles</a>, focusing on clear
            organization, consistent elements, and a soothing palette of reassuring blue shades.</p>
          <p>The app is friendly to everyone! It follows guidelines to make sure the colors and text are easy to
            see. Nevertheless, incorporation of specialized technology to assist users with diverse abilities is
            pending.

          <h3>UX Evolution: Collaborative Refinement</h3>
          <p>Untangled's design has been refined with the valuable input and suggestions from fellow UX designers,
            significantly shaping this latest version. The primary features are in place, but some issues still need
            attention. The "DocCreator" and Chatbot features, still need fine-tuning for optimal performance.</p>

          <h3>User-Centered Assessment and Expansion</h3>
          <p>Continued assessments are necessary to ensure alignment with business goals, including pricing
            accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, it's essential to assess user needs, preferences, and expectations with a specific focus on UI
            testing, A/B testing, accessibility and further usability testing.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would carry out a separate analysis tailored to a different audience, such as lawyers,
            legal firms, or other service providers interested in offering this service.
          </p>
          <h3>Final Reflections:</h3>
          <h4>Design Evolution:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The original and final versions of the web app have undergone significant changes. E.g. Initially, there
              was a lack of clarity regarding the home screen's purpose and the placement of the newsletter. However, by
              incorporating a newsletter on the home page featuring "latest relevant legal changes," users remained
              engaged. This addition may lead to increased interaction with the app and a more proactive approach to
              seeking legal assistance.
            </li>
            <li>The need to introduce previously unconsidered services, such as a newsletter focused on entrepreneurs
              and the impact of regulatory changes, became evident, which had a broad impact on the overall design.
            </li>
            <li>While the UI was improved through the use of tools like Figma and the implementation of Material Design
              principles and Gestalt Theory, there is still room for further enhancements.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Market Differentiators:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>There are similar legal apps internationally, but Untangled stands out for being tailored for Ecuadorian
              entrepreneurs.</li>
            <li>Each country presents unique challenges due to their regulatory frameworks; our app recognizes and
              addresses these differences.</li>
            <li>The design is unique, focusing on entrepreneurs seeking reliable legal services without the traditional
              high cost.</li>
            <li>Untangled App has a section for regulatory updates, a particular need in contexts with frequent changes
              in the country.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>User Focus and Possible Improvements:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="features">Addressing Lengthy Forms:</span> The design should better tackle the issue of
              lengthy, tedious forms that discourage user engagement. One solution is to integrate AI, which can assist
              users in completing the legal document creation process more efficiently, ultimately increasing app usage.
            </li>
            <li><span class="features">App Personalization:</span> There is an opportunity for further app
              personalization. Introducing a customization screen where users can input business-specific details would
              lead to highly specialized legal advice. This customization would also enable lawyers to access relevant
              information quickly, reducing the time spent gathering details.
            </li>
            <li><span class="features">Dual Demographic Targeting</span>: While the primary goal is to assist
              entrepreneurs facing cost-related challenges in accessing legal services, there is potential in targeting
              affluent entrepreneurs who seek an elegant application. This demographic is often willing to pay for legal
              services. In the future, the app could cater to both demographics.
            </li>
            <li><span class="features">Conveying Trust and Tranquility:</span> It's essential to convey trust and
              tranquility in the app design, especially considering that many users fear legal costs. The design should
              continue to prioritize creating a sense of trust and comfort for the tarjet users.</li>
            <li><span class="features">Collaborative Enrichment:</span> Collaborating with legal firms and additional
              lawyers would have enriched the project, particularly by integrating a comprehensive list of feasible
              services and their corresponding prices. This collaborative approach would enhance the value and offerings
              of the app.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Challenges and Tools:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Conducting usability tests alone was challenging; at times, I missed valuable details when noting user
              reactions. Moreover, not everyone was willing to be recorded, limiting subsequent review. Hence, I believe
              I should have conducted more tests, preferably in person, and with the support of an assistant.</li>
            <li>My initial skills in Figma limited the design of the first interactive prototype, though over time I
              improved my proficiency with the tool.</li>
            <li> Regarding UI, I would like to team up with a UI Designer to
              translate the findings on visual improvements.</li>
            <li>Due to time constraints, collaborating with a legal firm or additional lawyers was no possible. It would
              indeed have enriched the project,
              particularly in terms of integrating a comprehensive list of feasible services and their corresponding
              prices.
            </li>
