            <h3>Research Goals</h3>
            <p>‚û°Ô∏è The very first step was to deeply understand the problems faced by entrepreneurs when seeking legal
              advice.
            </p>
            <p>The main objectives of the research were:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Identify <span class="features">entrepreneurs' actions</span> when they require legal assistance.</li>
              <li>Understand their <span class="features">most common legal needs</span>.</li>
              <li>Uncover <span class="features">frustrations</span> experienced in obtaining legal advice.</li>
              <li>Determine the <span class="features">optimal approach</span> to meeting these needs and addressing
                frustrations.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A multifaceted approach was needed involving:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
              <li>Surveys and Interviews</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>üìà Conducted competitive analysis for user insights, product gaps, and enhancement opportunities.</p>
            <p>üåé The app targets Ecuadorian entrepreneurs, addressing their specific legal requirements in a market
              that's less developed than those in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
            <p>üì≤ Examined <span class="features">LegalZoom</span> and
              <span class="features">Rocket Lawyer</span>, using feedback from various app reviews for inspiration.

            <h3>Surveys and Interviews</h3>
            <p>Surveys offered initial user insights; in-depth interviews explored user preferences and needs.</p>
            <p>Interviews spanned entrepreneurs aged 28 to 54, reflecting Ecuador's typical entrepreneur age group, with
              five interviews conducted.</p>
            <h4>Summary of the 9 key findings</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>The competitive analysis targets key app features but overlooks specific needs like tracking
                regulatory updates crucial for Ecuadorian entrepreneurs.
              </li>
              <li>People typically seek advice from their trusted network for basic legal matters but are open to using
                legal apps.</li>
              <li>Desired app features encompass FAQs, lawyer consultations, document templates, reminders, in-app
                payments, and real-time guidance.</li>
              <li>Interviewees prioritize payment transparency, flexible payment options, and good customer service.
              </li>
              <li>Common legal needs include model contracts, notary proceedings, affidavits, deeds, and intellectual
                property protection.</li>
              <li>Some individuals stay informed about legal changes through news sources and social media.</li>
              <li>For tax-related legal matters, nearly all users turn to their accountants.</li>
              <li>Full-time entrepreneurs require comprehensive legal support, especially in areas like tax, labor, and
                intellectual property protection.</li>
              <li>Most interviewees need a lawyer several times a year, particularly those involved in business
                operations.</li>

        <h2>Define User Needs</h2>
        <div class="identifying">
          <p>During the Empathize phase, insights were consolidated and analyzed to identify core issues, leading to the
            creation of a problem statement:</p>
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p><span class="features">Entrepreneurs face difficulties in obtaining timely, reliable, and affordable legal
              services
              to safeguard their business interests. In response, a web application was developed to offer
              cost-effective, easy access to
              trustworthy legal advice and information, enabling entrepreneurs to address common legal questions
              efficiently, saving time
              and money.</span></p>
          <p>Subsequently, to humanize the design process, personas were developed as the focus shifted to the Ideation
            phase.

          <h3>User Journeys</h3>
          <p>A user journey illustrates the sequence of actions taken by someone using a product to achieve a goal.
            Let's look at how Sebastian and Pamela would use the app for legal advice:
          </p>
          <div class="userjourney">
            <p><span class="features">üíÅüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sebastian,</span> wants to secure his intellectual property rights as a

                allowfullscreen />

          <p><span class="features">üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pamela,</span> a small business owner, seeks legal consultation to

          </div>
          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>User flows map out the steps users take to complete tasks within the app, crucial for understanding and
            improving user experience. For each app feature, specific user flows are designed. The flows for the
            features
            "Ask a Lawyer" and "Legal DocCreator" are outlined to facilitate these tasks.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <div class="solution">
          <p>üí° After thoroughly understanding the users and defining the problem, the Ideation Phase began.</p>
          <p>üí≠ This phase involved brainstorming numerous possible solutions, leading to the development of a Sitemap
            that outlines the structure of the web application.</p>
          <p>‚úÖ The Sitemap was refined using Card Sorting Results, which then paved the way for designing low and
            mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
          <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
          <p>Card sorting is a technique used in user research where participants organize content into categories,
            which helps optimize the structure of websites and apps.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/untangled/@2card.png" class="centered">
            <img src="img/untangled/@3card.png" alt="Card Sorting Methodology" style="width: 100%; padding: 8px;">
          </picture>
          <p>The open card sorting exercise provided key insights:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Many participants, unfamiliar with legal terms,
              <span class="features">struggled to classify items accurately</span>. Despite this, maintaining the
              existing
              legal categorization made sense (Ask a Lawyer and DocCreator as 2 separate features).
            </li>
            <li>The exercise emphasized the importance of a <span class="features">comprehensive onboarding
                process</span>
              to help users comprehend the application's functions and navigate it
              effectively.</li>
            <li>Also, to address user confusion, the feature Q&A section with FAQs should be added. <span
                class="features">Legal services can be complex
                for non-lawyers</span>.</li>
            <li>The exercise highlighted the need to exclude "My legal documents" and "My lawyers' answers" from the "My
              profile" section and <span class="features">remove several cards to simplify processes</span>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In response to the card sorting results and an usability test, the site map has been updated three times,
            leading to this latest version:</p>

            leading to a more user-friendly content organization.

          <p>By reducing the number of categories, the application became more navigable and simpler for users to
            understand.
          </p>
          <p>This streamlining allowed for the creation of cost-effective paper prototypes, which are basic
            representations of the web application and its four core features, to assess their Desirability,
            Feasibility, and Viability.

          <h4>Discoverability Issues</h4>
          <p>Users found value in the app but had difficulty with specific tasks, confusing "profile" and "home"
            sections.
          </p>
          <h4>Two Personas Emerged</h4>
          <p>Two user categories emerged: financially privileged entrepreneurs who value app elegance and lower-income
            users focused on affordability and ease of use.
          </p>
          <p>Based on the goal of this project, feedback from the target persona of entrepreneurs in need of
            affordable legal advice will be prioritized.</p>
          <h4>The Need to Alleviate Legal Service Concerns</h4>
          <p>During the usability tests, users expressed concerns about the cost and complexity of legal services.
            Recognizing the need to create a calming and reassuring app environment, research was done on colors that
            evoke calmness. Blue and green were identified as suitable choices for the legal app due to their calming
            properties.
          </p>
          <p>A color preference test was conducted to decide between the two, resulting in a strong preference for blue,
            with 83% of participants favoring it over green. Blue was thus selected for the app's design, supported by
            user feedback highlighting blue as a classic and trustworthy color.

          <h4>Visual and Language Design</h4>
          <p>1. Blue was chosen as the main color after a preference test due to its association with trust.</p>
          <p>2. Lawyer photos and a white background were used for a professional look.</p>
          <p>3. Friendly, non-judgmental language was selected to make users feel supported and encourage open
            engagement with legal issues.</p>

          <h3>Design Harmony and Accessibility Commitment</h3>
          <p>The design of the Untangled app has evolved through a collaborative and iterative process, incorporating
            feedback from UX peers and adhering to <a
              href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles#what_are_the_gestalt_principles?-0"
              target="_blank" style="color: #00306b;">Gestalt Theory</a> and <a

          <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
          <p>The design refinements have been significantly influenced by suggestions from fellow UX designers, leading
            to a more sophisticated version of the app. Key features are established, yet "DocCreator" and Chatbot
            functionalities require further development for enhanced performance.

          <h3>User-Centered Approach</h3>
          <p>Ongoing evaluations are crucial for aligning with business objectives and maintaining pricing
            accessibility. Regular user assessments focusing on UI testing, A/B testing, accessibility, and additional
            usability testing are planned to ensure the app meets user expectations and needs.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Analyses</h3>
          <p>Separate analyses for different stakeholders such as lawyers and legal firms are planned to tailor the
            service offerings to their requirements.</p>
          <h3>Reflecting on Design Changes</h3>
          <p>The web app has undergone considerable modifications from its inception. For instance, initial ambiguity
            about the home screen's function was resolved by featuring a newsletter highlighting recent legal updates,
            increasing user engagement and support for legal inquiries. The introduction of services like a regulatory
            change newsletter has significantly influenced the overall design. While the UI has been enhanced through
            tools like Figma and design principles, opportunities for improvement remain.
          </p>
          <h4>Distinctive Market Position</h4>
          <p>Untangled differentiates itself by catering specifically to Ecuadorian entrepreneurs, acknowledging the
            unique
            challenges of the local regulatory environment. Its design prioritizes affordability and reliability in
            legal
            services, including a section for regulatory updates which is vital in dynamic legal contexts.
          </p>

          <h4>Enhancement Opportunities</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Simplifying Forms</b>: Incorporating AI could streamline the process of filling out lengthy forms, boosting
              user
              interaction.</li>
            <li><b>Personalization</b>: Adding a feature for users to provide business-specific details could offer more
              tailored
              legal advice and efficiency for lawyers.</li>
            <li><b>Broadening User Base</b>: While focusing on cost-conscious entrepreneurs, potential exists to also attract
              affluent entrepreneurs seeking a sophisticated user experience.</li>
            <li><b>Trust and Comfort</b>: The design should continue to emphasize trust and tranquility, crucial for users
              concerned
              with legal costs.</li>
            <li><b>Legal Collaboration</b>: Partnering with more legal professionals could provide a wider range of services
              and pricing, adding value to the app.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Challenges and Tools</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Usability Testing</b>: Conducting tests solo was challenging. More extensive testing, especially in person
              with an assistant, could capture more nuanced feedback.</li>
            <li><b>Design Tools</b>: While initial proficiency in Figma was limited, skill level has since improved.</li>
            <li><b>UI Collaboration</b>: Partnering with a UI Designer could better translate visual improvement findings.</li>
            <li><b>Legal Insights</b>: Time constraints limited collaboration with legal professionals, an aspect that could
              greatly enrich the app's offerings.</li>
