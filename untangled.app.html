      <div class="userresearch">
        <div>
          <h3>Research Goals</h3>
          <p>The very first step: ➡️ To deeply understand the problems faced by entrepreneurs when seeking legal advice.
          </p>
          <p>The main objectives of the research were:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify <span class="features">entrepreneurs' actions</span> when they require legal assistance.</li>
            <li>Understand their <span class="features">most common legal needs</span>.</li>
            <li>Uncover <span class="features">frustrations</span> experienced in obtaining legal advice.</li>
            <li>Determine the <span class="features">optimal approach</span> to meeting these needs and addressing
              frustrations.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Research Methods</h3>
          <p>A multifaceted approach was needed involving:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
            <li>Surveys and Interviews</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p>📈The research project began with a competitive analysis to gather user insights and frustrations, identify
            product
            weaknesses, and uncover opportunities for differentiation and improvement.
          </p>
          <p>🌎In Ecuador, there is currently a lack of highly developed legal apps, similar to those in the United
            States
            and Europe.</p>
          <p>📲To draw inspiration, we studied two popular platforms, <span class="features">LegalZoom</span> and <span
              class="features">Rocket Lawyer</span>, and incorporated
            feedback from app reviews, including App Review, TechCrunch, GetApp, and more.</p>

              <ul>
                <p>Based on the competitive analysis, the hypothesis is that incorporating these features will make the

          <h3>Surveys and Interviews</h3>
          <p>Surveys provided preliminary insights, while interviews delved deeper into user preferences and
            requirements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The interviews with the entrepreneurs covered a wide range of ages, from 28 to 54 years old, the age
              range in which most Ecuadorian entrepreneurs are found.</li>
            <li>There were a total of 5️⃣ interviews.</li>

              Survey and Interviews Main Findings
            </summary>
            <div>
              <p>Here's a quick summary of the 8 key findings:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Common legal needs include model contracts, notary proceedings, affidavits, deeds, and
                  intellectual
                  property protection.</li>
                <li>Full-time entrepreneurs require comprehensive legal support.</li>
                <li>Most interviewees need a lawyer several times a year, especially those running businesses.</li>
                <li>For basic legal matters, people tend to consult their trusted network, but they are open to
                  using legal apps.</li>
                <li>While many are aware of digital legal services, they primarily use them for simple legal issues.
                </li>
                <li>Some stay informed about legal changes through the news and by reading newspaper articles or
                  social media.</li>
                <li>The desired app features include FAQs, lawyer consultations,
                  document templates, reminders, in-app payments, and reliable real-time guidance.</li>
                <li>Payment transparency, flexible payment options, and customer service are essential to
                  interviewees.</li>
                <li>For tax legal matter, almost all users turn to their accountants.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </details>
          <br>
          <h3>Initial Insights</h3>
          <p>The competitive analysis-based hypothesis suggests essential app features but overlooks other critical
            findings from the survey and interviews:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Specific legal needs (types of legal services).</li>
            <li>Consultation frequency.</li>
            <li>Trust in existing networks, especially for tax issues (almost all users turn to accountants).</li>
            <li>Preference for using legal apps for "simple legal matters".</li>
            <li>The need of staying informed about regulatory changes.</li>

      <h2>Ideate: Generate Ideas</h2>
      <div class="solution">
        <p>💡Following a deep dive into user understanding and the definition of the problem statement, <span
            class="features">the Ideation Phase was initiated.</span></p>
        <p>💭A wide array of potential solutions was brainstormed, resulting in the creation of a <span
            class="features">Sitemap</span>—a tool that represents the structure of the web application.</p>
        <p>✅The initial Sitemap was subsequently refined based on <span class="features">Card Sorting Results</span>,
          allowing for the progression to the design of low and mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
        <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
        <p>Card sorting is a user research method where participants categorize information to improve website and app
          organization.</p>

        </picture>
        <p>During the open card sorting exercise, where participants independently group and label website content, many
          important insights became evident. Here are the main ones:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Many participants, unfamiliar with legal terms,
            <span class="features">struggled to classify items accurately</span>. Despite this, maintaining the existing
            legal categorization made sense (Ask a Lawyer and DocCreator as 2 separate features).
          </li>
          <li>The exercise emphasized the importance of a <span class="features">comprehensive onboarding process</span>
            to help users comprehend the application's functions and navigate it
            effectively.</li>
          <li>Also, to address user confusion, the feature Q&A section with FAQs should be added.<span
              class="features">Legal services can be complex
              for non-lawyers</span>.</li>
          <li>The exercise highlighted the need to exclude "My legal documents" and "My lawyers' answers" from the "My
            profile" section and <span class="features">remove several cards to simplify processes</span>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In response to the card sorting results and an usability test, the site map has been updated three times,
          leading to this latest version:</p>

      <div class="prototype">
        <p>🎯The sitemap was adjusted to better match the user's perception and
          reality of legal service delivery, resulting in a more intuitive organization of content.</p>
        <p>#️⃣The number of
          categories was reduced to make it easier for users to navigate and understand the application.</p>
        <p>Now, it was possible to design 💵cost-effective paper prototypes of simplified versions of the web
          application and the four basic features
          to explore its Desirability, Feasibility, and Viability:</p>

          <p><span class="features">Three noteworthy findings are:</span></p>
          <h4>Discoverability Issues</h4>
          <p>The 6 usability tests revealed issues mostly related to discoverability. Users appreciated the app's
            utility but struggled with tasks 1, 3, and 4, and often confused between "profile" and "home".</p>
          <h4>Two Personas Emerged</h4>
          <p>User feedback has illuminated two distinct user categories:</p>
          <li>Financially privileged entrepreneurs seeking elegance in the app</li>
          <li>Lower-income users concerned about affordability and user-friendliness.</li>
          <p>Based on the goal of this project, feedback from the target persona of entrepreneurs in need of
            affordable legal advice will be prioritized. However, this depends on business goals.
          </p>
          <h4>The Need to Alleviate Legal Service Concerns</h4>
          <p>During the usability test, I observed that certain users expressed apprehension regarding the cost of
            legal services and the complexity of legal issues, understandably so, as these topics can be unsettling
            for many. After conducting research on colors known to evoke a sense of calmness, I determined that
            using
            blue and green would be suitable color options for a legal app.</p>
          <p>A preference test regarding colors was performed. The results of the test revealed a significant
            distinction between blue and green colors, with
            83% favoring blue. Therefore, blue tones were chosen as they were the preferred color. One user even
            remarked that blue is a classic, clean color often associated with trust.</p>

        <h3>UX Evolution: Collaborative Refinement</h3>
        <p>Untangled's design has been refined with the valuable input and suggestions from fellow UX designers,
          significantly shaping this latest version. The primary features are in place, but some issues still need
          attention. The "DocCreator" and Chatbot features, still need fine-tuning for optimal performance.</p>
        <h3>User-Centered Assessment and Expansion</h3>

        <p>Continued assessments are necessary to ensure alignment with business goals, including pricing
          accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, it's essential to assess user needs, preferences, and expectations with a specific focus on UI
          testing, A/B testing, accessibility and usability testing and user feedback surveys.</p>
        <p>Lastly, it's crucial to carry out a separate analysis tailored to a different audience, such as lawyers,
          legal firms, or other service providers interested in offering this service.

        <h3>Final Reflections:</h3>
        <h4>Design Evolution:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The original and final versions of the web app differ significantly.</li>
          <li>Investigations and utility tests revealed that the main menu should highlight the app's main features.
          </li>
          <li>I realized it wasn't necessary to separate each feature into different screens, leading me to reduce the
            number of pages.</li>
          <li>Additionally, I identified the need to implement services I hadn't initially considered, especially
            regarding regulatory changes that impact entrepreneurs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Market Differentiators:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>There are similar legal apps internationally, but Untangled stands out for being tailored for Ecuadorian
            entrepreneurs.</li>
          <li>Each country presents unique challenges due to their regulatory frameworks; our app recognizes and
            addresses these differences.</li>
          <li>The design is unique, focusing on entrepreneurs seeking reliable legal services without the traditional
            high cost.</li>
          <li>We have a section for regulatory updates, a particular need in contexts with frequent changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User Focus and Possible Improvements:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I noticed many people feel fear when thinking about legal costs, leading me to choose a design that
            conveys trust and tranquility.</li>
          <li>In retrospect, I would've liked to explore a design that also appeals to wealthier entrepreneurs.</li>
          <li>I believe collaborating with legal firms and more lawyers would have enriched the project, especially to
            integrate pro-bono services and a complete list of services and prices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Challenges and Tools:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Conducting usability tests alone was challenging; at times, I missed valuable details when noting user
            reactions.</li>
          <li>Not everyone was willing to be recorded, limiting subsequent review.</li>
          <li>My initial skills in Figma limited the design of the first interactive prototype, though over time I
            improved my proficiency with the tool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Lessons for Future Projects:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If I could start over, I would replicate the process up to the usability tests.</li>
          <li>I believe I should have conducted more tests, preferably in person, and with the support of an assistant.
          </li>
        </ul>
